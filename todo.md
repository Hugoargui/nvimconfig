# NEAR FUTURE 
- check this take on word movement vs spider/smartword:
    https://old.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/181bsu8/my_take_on_a_word_movement/
- improve build/compile/run life-cycle. 

# MEDIUM TERM IDEAS
- python REPL
- tabout plugin
- try tabtree navigation mapped to { and } https://github.com/roobert/tabtree.nvim
- figure out how to make spellchecker ignore url links (and maybe stuff between quotes).
- incremental selection
- incorporate the awesome cpp snippets I found https://github.com/t-troebst/config.nvim/blob/master/snippets/cpp.lua
- incorporate algorithm mnemonics for cpp
- find way to dim unused variables, neodim breaks highlights
- git
        - integrating Git in nvim youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57x4ZzzCr2Y&pp=ygUdaW50ZWdyYXRpbiBnaXQgdmltIGFuZCBuZW92aW0%3D
        - Git mergetool tutorial with git: https://gist.github.com/karenyyng/f19ff75c60f18b4b8149
        - compare to mergetool, other plugins
    - lazygit is nice but not so vim like, replace by git ui that allows to move around with vim window motions
- Highlight undo plugin (I tried but didn't manage to make it highlight, not worth the time for now)
- Modes.nvim to highlight deleted lines and changed lines.
- sibling-swap.nvim
- Arpeggio -> asdf for page scrolling, see arpeggio issues about remap warning
- Arpeggio for number motions (w+k = 5w for example)

# LONG TIME IDEAS, NOT URGENT
- improve search and replace workflow, by example by using Spectre
- remove cursor when navigating nerdtree
- FLASH jump plugin
- still not totally happy with yank interface
- try the moonicipal task runner or another task runner

# LONGER TERM GOALS
- 'jceb/blinds.nvim', and vim.g.blinds_guibg = '#450341' gives nice results. Consider this alternative

# CHANGES IN WORKFLOW
this are pretty big changes that I'd like to explore someday, but are not critical right now
- try structural search and replace
- try yode-nvim
- try multicursors
- try ideas from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U420QymHjlA
- AI (copilot or similar)
