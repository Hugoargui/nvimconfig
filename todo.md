# NEAR FUTURE 
- trouble
- tabout plugin
- navbuddy

# MEDIUM TERM IDEAS
- dial
- fix folding hydra
- spellchecker
- Make markdown embedded code work... headlines plugin... nvim-feMaco.lua
- incremental selection
- move shortcuts to open files from <leader> mappings to \ mappings (\is file, \\ is folders). Maybe add a permanent todo
- incorporate the awesome cpp snippets I found https://github.com/t-troebst/config.nvim/blob/master/snippets/cpp.lua
- improve search and replace workflow, by example by using Spectre
- terminal is more usable now but: escape inside lazygit goes into insert mode instead of closing commit window, fix this.
- tabs (viewports) workflow. Switching, and unique buffers per tab.
- vim fugitive
-     'jceb/blinds.nvim', and vim.g.blinds_guibg = '#450341' gives nices results. consider this alternative 

# LONG TIME IDEAS, NOT URGENT
- remove cursor when navigating nerdtree
- try a hop/leap/ similar jump plugin
- still not totally happy with yank interface
- try the moonicipal task runner
- consider readding nvim_context_vt with more lines, once i see if I miss it

# LONGER TERM GOALS
- lazygit is nice but not so vim like, replace by git ui that allows to move around with vim window motions

# CHANGES IN workflow
this are pretty big changes that I'd like to explore someday, but are not critical right now
- try structural search and replace
- try yode-nvim
- try multicursors
- try ideas from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U420QymHjlA
- AI (copilot or similar)
