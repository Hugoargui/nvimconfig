# NEAR FUTURE 
- readline plugin github does not exist... Replace by custom maps
- tabout plugin
- navbuddy
- dial
- mappings to add newlines above/bellow in normal/insert mode
- mapping to "isolate the line", space above and bellow in one go
- check this take on word movement vs spider/smartword:

# MEDIUM TERM IDEAS
- incremental selection
- incorporate the awesome cpp snippets I found https://github.com/t-troebst/config.nvim/blob/master/snippets/cpp.lua
- improve search and replace workflow, by example by using Spectre
- terminal is more usable now but: escape inside lazygit goes into insert mode instead of closing commit window, fix this.
- tabs (viewports) workflow. Switching, and unique buffers per tab.
- better qf list, and learn to use it
- git integration:
    - git mergetool 
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57x4ZzzCr2Y&pp=ygUdaW50ZWdyYXRpbiBnaXQgdmltIGFuZCBuZW92aW0%3D
        - https://gist.github.com/karenyyng/f19ff75c60f18b4b8149
        - compare to mergetool, other plugins
    - lazygit is nice but not so vim like, replace by git ui that allows to move around with vim window motions

# LONG TIME IDEAS, NOT URGENT
- remove cursor when navigating nerdtree
- FLASH jump plugin
- still not totally happy with yank interface
- try the moonicipal task runner
- consider reading nvim_context_vt with more lines, once i see if I miss it

# LONGER TERM GOALS
- 'jceb/blinds.nvim', and vim.g.blinds_guibg = '#450341' gives nice results. Consider this alternative

# CHANGES IN workflow
this are pretty big changes that I'd like to explore someday, but are not critical right now
- try structural search and replace
- try yode-nvim
- try multicursors
- try ideas from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U420QymHjlA
- AI (copilot or similar)
