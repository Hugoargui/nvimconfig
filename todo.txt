move shortcuts to open files from <leader> mappings to \ mappings (\is file, \\ is folders). Maybe add a permanent todo 
improve search and replace workflo, by example by using Spectre
optimize command line workflow try fine-cmd-line wilder...
cokeline fix chose buffer to jump or close
terminal is more usable now but: escape inside lazygit goes into insert mode instead of closing commit window, fix this. 
terminal: the size of the terminal stays weird when changing between different terminals
terminal: there is a nize plugin called kwkarlwang/bufresize to preserve window size when opening/closing, consider it (this is not only related to terminal)
consider supercharging tab for snippet expansion, plus tabout plugin
